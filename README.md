## :information_source: More about

The description of all functions are as comments in the scripts inside the "programa Ã¡gua" path , all variables and counts are already described in the scripts as well.
If you want to learn some about pyqt5 you can also use the scritpt to understand some functionalities, the comments are very clear and you can modify their images and pyqt functions if you want to, good to train.
Simple functions were used, maybe could be optimized.

Have fun! :)
