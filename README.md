# Water-Waste-Calculator
This programm written in python has to goal to show to every people that will use it, how many liters of water do they and their family spend monthly by taking shower. The programm is already converted into one ziped file where the Setup is done and then you can install the programm in yout computer and execute without needing any other download to run. 
The description of all functions used are as comments in the scrip, all variables and counts are already described in the script as well.
If you want to learn some about pyqt5 you can also use the scritpt to understand some functions, they are very clear and you can modify their images and pyqt functions if you want to, good to train.
Simple functions were used, maybe could be optimized.
Have fun!
